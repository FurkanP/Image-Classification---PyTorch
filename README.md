# Pytorch

PyTorch is an open-source Python machine learning library, based on Torch, used for tasks like NLP and image classification. It shares core C libraries with Torch and is optimized for efficient Python execution, with GPU acceleration. PyTorch simplifies building and training CNNs, enabling automated feature extraction and learning from large image datasets.




## Convolutional Neural Net

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a deep learning algorithm that processes images by learning important features to tell objects apart. Unlike older methods that use hand-made filters, CNNs learn these filters automatically during training. The structure of CNNs is similar to how the brain's neurons work, especially in the visual cortex, where each neuron reacts to a small part of what we see, and together they cover the entire image.

## Steps to Run

There are two methods to execute the end-to-end workflow:

-Modular Code
-IPython 

### Modular code

-Create a virtual environment.
-Install the required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt
-Run the code: python Engine.py
-Check the output for all visualizations.

### IPython 

Follow the instructions in the notebook `CNN.ipynb`
